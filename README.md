A family member asked me to update an existing landing page for their maths educational resource website. 

The brief included keeping the design in line with other products within their brand and keeping the original colour scheme to make sure the users weren’t confused by this change in style. 

I decided to use Materialize for the design as this is developed with Google’s Material U.I. language that is used widely throughout many of Googles products. Meaning users are likely to have come into contact with this style of design previously ensuring it is familiar and not confusing. I decided to build on this by adding icons that would draw the eye of the user and give them subtle clues to the functions of various parts of the page. I also integrated the Materialise carousel to display user reviews in an aesthetically pleasing way, whilst also being responsive to different screen sizes, handily, the user is also able to swipe through reviews on touch screen devices. 

The design is completely responsive as a large amount of traffic comes through on mobile, however, a large proportion of the educational content is designed to be used on an interactive whiteboard, so this had to be taken into account in the design process. 

The landing page isn’t yet live due to technical difficulties in deployment unrelated to my design work. Hopefully these will be resolved swiftly and my design will be deployed soon.
