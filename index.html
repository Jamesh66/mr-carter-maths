                Mr Carter Maths is such a time saver when planning lessons, I
                can’t recommend it enough! The differentiated questions allow
                all students in my sessions to access the topic at their own
                confidence level and the answers are always readily available to
                check their understanding. My students love using the site for

                MrCarterMaths helps our maths teachers differentiate lessons
                with high-quality, repeatable and relevant questions. It is
                accessible and easy to use and students like to use it for
                revision too. We use it for generating questions to use as
                worked examples at different levels of difficulty as well as
                questions for students to do to practise new learning and
                consolidate prior learning. The site increases impact for
                students while reducing workload for teachers.

                Mr Carter Maths has been an invaluable tool for me during my
                Teach First placement. I project the questions onto my board
                every day as starter, which has reduced my workload immensely.
                The comprehensive list of topics available enables me to quickly
                and easily revise previously taught content, and the range of
                questions presented means that all students are stretched. The
                layout of the site is also beautifully simple and clean, meaning
                it is easy to use, and does not confuse students when projected.
                I would recommend the site to any of my colleagues

                I really enjoy using MrCarterMaths as it allows for quick and
                easy differentiation. I like to use them as a starting point in
                lessons to recap topics already covered, as it quickly picks up
                any misconceptions, then again as a plenary or mini plenary.
                Having the answers also helps to reduce workload as students can
                self-mark. The gold questions really stretch the most able
                students. It is my go-to when starting a new topic and there is
                a huge range of topic areas. I will be subscribing when it
                becomes a paid service.

                Mr Carter Maths is an essential resource for efficient lesson
                planning. The range of topics covered is second to none and the
                differentiation on every task makes topics accessible to all
                learners whilst also providing a high level of challenge. I have
                found a range of uses for the custom questions function and
                MrCarterMaths is my first port of call for independent practice
                work.

                I use Mr Carter's differentiated questions often: Frequently as
                part of my planned lessons with classes where there are
                substantial discrepancies in the ability of students. They make
                a great tool to move more able students on after my whole class
                teaching input and let the others practise 'the basics'. The
                questions have also 'saved my bacon' on several occasions as an
                emergency extension, or when I had to put in an instant change
                of plan. I have even used them to provide work
                for students on the very odd occasion I have any that are unable
                to stay in the classroom. All topics are brilliantly structured
                and populated with relevant questions only. I always know it's
                'safe to use'. Even more importantly: the students love doing
                some of the bronze questions, deciding when to move to silver
                after having completed the minimum set in bronze and mastering
                gold, it gives them a great sense of achievement! I will very
                happily pay the (almost nominal) subscription fee in order to
                use this brilliant service, I would be lost without it now.
                Thanks Mr Carter!
